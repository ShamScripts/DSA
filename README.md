# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab  
**Semester 2 (2025-26)**  
**Language:** Java  

This repository contains Java programs for weekly lab exercises in the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. Each folder corresponds to one week of lab work and includes well-documented code based on standard algorithmic techniques.

---

## Folder-wise Breakdown

### WEEK1 — Stack Operations using Arrays
- Implement a stack using arrays.
- Push and pop multiple student records (`ID, Name, DOB, CGPA`) read from a file.
- Write popped records to an output file.

### WEEK2 — Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation
- Convert a user-entered **infix expression** to **postfix**.
- Evaluate the postfix expression using stack.
- Custom stack implementation (no in-built stack classes allowed).

### WEEK3 — Circular Queue using Array
- Implement a circular queue for student records.
- Perform enqueue and dequeue operations using a file.
- Display students whose CGPA is less than 9.

### WEEK4 — Doubly Linked List (DLL)
- Maintain a sorted DLL of student records by ID.
- Menu-driven operations:
  - Add, delete, search by ID
  - Display in descending order
  - Find student with highest CGPA

### WEEK5 — Linear and Binary Search
- Initialize an array with 10,000+ float values.
- Implement and compare Linear Search vs Binary Search.
- Measure and print search time and iteration count.

### WEEK6 — Merge Sort
- Sort a list of employee records (`Name, ID, Salary`) by **name** using Merge Sort.
- Show intermediate merging stages.
- Display unsorted and sorted lists.
- Measure execution time.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShamScripts/DSA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to any week's folder.
3. Compile and run the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
### Notes

- All programs are written in **Java** with a focus on **clarity** and **modularity**.
- **File handling** and **user interaction** are incorporated where relevant.
- **Timer functions** are used for **performance analysis** in applicable labs.
