Data Structures & Algorithms (CS F211)

**Lab Exercise 1**


Write a C/C++/Java program to perform the following actions on a STACK implemented using arrays/array of structures:

1) Implement PUSH operation in a STACK for N (N >= 5) STUDENT RECORDS. Each STUDENT RECORD should store 

   <IDNO, NAME, DOB, CGPA>. 

   You have to read each *STUDENT record* from an input file “***studentin.dat***” stored locally in your directory and the PUSH it into the stack, one at a time. (You can use ***vi*** editor to create input data file. Make sure that the input data file contains at least 5 records).

1) Implement the **POP** operation for the STACK in LIFO order and **display** all the records on the standard output (screen). Also, write the output results into an external file “**studentout.dat**”.

Test Scenario

Test Input: (read from external file: studentin.dat)

ID                     	NAME 	DOB      	CGPA
