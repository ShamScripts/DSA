# Lab Exercise 4  
### Doubly Linked List (DLL) Implementation

---

### Objective

Write a **C/C++/Java** program to implement a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** to store the following student information:
- **Name** (String)
- **Student IDNO** (int)
- **Branch** (CS, BT, CE, CHE, EEE)
- **CGPA** (float)

The program should be **menu-driven** and allow the user to perform the following operations repeatedly until they choose to **Exit**.

---

### Tasks

1. **Add Student**  
   Add a new student such that the **list remains sorted** in **ascending order of Student IDNO**, regardless of insertion order.  
   *(Assume Student ID numbers are unique)*

2. **Delete Student**  
   Delete a student record from the list by providing their **Student IDNO**.

3. **Search Student**  
   Search and display the details of a student using their **Student IDNO**.

4. **Display All Students**  
   Display all student records in **descending order** of IDNO.

5. **Best Performer**  
   Search and display the **student with the highest CGPA**.

6. **Exit**  
   Exit the program gracefully.
